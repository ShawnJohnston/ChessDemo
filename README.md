# ChessDemo

This is a side project that attempts to become a playable version of a Chess application.

Current status: Phase 1

Phase 1:
- The program instantiates a starting board, and all pieces are coded to be moved into positions that they are legally allowed to.
- The pieces can be removed from the board if taken.
- The game will end if a player makes a checkmate, draw, or no legal moves are possible.

Phase 2:
- The user can play against a chess CPU

Phase 3:
- Network support for online play.
